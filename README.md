# Frontend Mentor - Pricing component with toggle solution

## Overwiev

This repository holds my solution to the [Pricing component with toggle challenge on Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/pricing-component-with-toggle-8vPwRMIC). Frontend Mentor challenges are frontend exercices where you can test yourself, improve your coding or generally try new things while building realistic projects.

## The challenge

The challenge here was to build a pricing component with an optimal layout depending on the user's device's screen size. There should also be a toggle to control payment plan and an active state for the currently reviewed option.

## How it went

This challenge was definitely fun because toggle controls always are. I used a bit of JS to get the toggle working but I feel like it's cheating since the bonus challenge here was to make everything work with HTML and CSS only so I'll try to do it again sometime, this time no cheating.
